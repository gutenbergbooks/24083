</div><p class="cap"><span class="dcap">o</span> have attempted in former times a work of
this description, would have seemed, we cannot
deny, to savour either of presumption or of
idiotcy, or more probably of both. And rightly. But
we live in times of progress. The mystery of yesterday
is the common-place of to-day; the Bible, which was
Newton's oracle, is Professor Huxley's jest-book; and
students at the University now lose a class for not being
familiar with opinions, which but twenty years ago they
would have been expelled for dreaming of. Everything
is moving onward swiftly and satisfactorily; and if,
when we have made all faiths fail, we can only contrive
to silence the British Association, and so make all knowledge
vanish away, there will lack nothing but the
presence of a perfect charity to turn the nineteenth century
into a complete kingdom of heaven. Amongst
changes, then, so great and so hopeful&mdash;amongst the
discoveries of the rights of women, the infallibility
of the Pope, and the physical basis of life, it may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
well be doubted if the great fathers of ancient song
would find, if they could come back to us, anything out
of the way or ludicrous in a recipe-book for concocting
poetry.</p>

<p>Some, indeed, object that poetry is not progressive.
But on what grounds this assertion is based, it is not
possible to conjecture. Poetry is as much progressive
as anything else in these days of progress. Free-thought
itself shews scarcely more strikingly those three great
stages which mark advance and movement. For poetry,
like Free-thought, was first a work of inspiration, secondly
of science, and lastly now of trick. At its first stage it was
open to only here and there a genius; at its next to all
intelligent men; and at its third to all the human race.
Thus, just as there is no boy now, but can throw stones
at the windows which Bishop Colenso has broken, so
there is scarcely even a young lady but can raise flowers
from the seed stolen out of Mr. Tennyson's garden.</p>

<p>And surely, whatever, in this its course of change,
poetry may have lost in quality, is more than made up for
by what it has gained in quantity. For in the first place
it is far pleasanter to the tastes of a scientific generation,
to understand how to make bad poetry than to wonder
at good; and secondly, as the end of poetry is pleasure,
that we should make it each for ourselves is the very
utmost that we can desire, since it is a fact in which we
all agree, that no man's verses please him so much as
his own.</p>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/004.png" width="61" height="58" alt="P" title="P" />
</div><p class="cap"><span class="dcap">oetry</span> as practised by the latest masters, is the
art of expressing what is too foolish, too
profane, or too indecent to be expressed in any
other way. And thus, just as a consummate cook will
prepare a most delicate repast out of the most poor
materials, so will the modern poet concoct us a most
popular poem from the weakest emotions, and the most
tiresome platitudes. The only difference is, that the
cook would prefer good materials if he could get them,
whilst the modern poet will take the bad from choice. As
far, however, as the nature of materials goes, those which
the two artists work with are the same&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, animals,
vegetables, and spirits. It was the practice of Shakespeare
and other earlier masters to make use of all these
together, mixing them in various proportions. But the
moderns have found that it is better and far easier to
employ each separately. Thus Mr. Swinburne uses very
little else but animal matter in the composition of his
dishes, which it must be confessed are somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
unwholesome in consequence: whilst the late Mr. Wordsworth,
on the contrary, confined himself almost exclusively
to the confection of primrose pudding, and flint
soup, flavoured with the lesser-celandine; and only now
and then a beggar-boy boiled down in it to give it a
colour. The robins and drowned lambs which he was
wont to use, when an additional piquancy was needed, were
employed so sparingly that they did not destroy in the least
the general vegetable tone of his productions; and these
form in consequence an unimpeachable lenten diet. It is
difficult to know what to say of Mr. Tennyson, as the
milk and water of which his books are composed chiefly,
make it almost impossible to discover what was the
original nature of the materials he has boiled down in
it. Mr. Shelley, too, is perhaps somewhat embarrassing
to classify; as, though spirits are what he affected most,
he made use of a large amount of vegetable matter also.
We shall be probably not far wrong in describing his
material as a kind of methylated spirits; or pure psychic
alcohol, strongly tinctured with the barks of trees, and
rendered below proof by a quantity of sea-water. In
this division of the poets, however, into animalists,
spiritualists, and vegetarians, we must not be discouraged
by any such difficulties as these; but must bear in mind
that in whatever manner we may neatly classify anything,
the exceptions and special cases will always far
outnumber those to which our rule applies.</p>

<p>But in fact, at present, mere theory may be set entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
aside: for although in the case of action, the
making and adhering to a theory may be the surest
guide to inconsistency and absurdity, in poetry these
results can be obtained without such aid.</p>

<p>The following recipes, compiled from a careful analysis
of the best authors, will be found, we trust, efficient
guides for the composition of genuine poems. But the
tyro must bear always in mind that there is no royal
road to anything, and that not even the most explicit
directions will make a poet all at once of even the most
fatuous, the most sentimental, or the most profane.</p>

</div><p class="cap"><span class="dcap">he</span> following are arranged somewhat in the
order in which the student is recommended to
begin his efforts. About the more elaborate
ones, which come later, he may use his own discretion
as to which he will try first; but he must previously
have had some training in the simpler compositions,
with which we deal before all others. These form as it
were a kind of pal&aelig;stra of folly, a very short training
in which will suffice to break down that stiffness and
self-respect in the soul, which is so incompatible with
modern poetry. Taking, therefore, the silliest and commonest
of all kinds of verse, and the one whose sentiments
come most readily to hand in vulgar minds, we
begin with directions,</p>

<h3><a name="HOW_TO_MAKE_AN_ORDINARY_LOVE_POEM" id="HOW_TO_MAKE_AN_ORDINARY_LOVE_POEM"></a>HOW TO MAKE AN ORDINARY LOVE POEM.</h3>

<p>Take two large and tender human hearts, which
match one another perfectly. Arrange these close together,
but preserve them from actual contact by placing
between them some cruel barrier. Wound them both in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
several places, and insert through the openings thus
made a fine stuffing of wild yearnings, hopeless tenderness,
and a general admiration for stars. Then completely
cover up one heart with a sufficient quantity of
chill church-yard mould, which may be garnished
according to taste with dank waving weeds or tender
violets: and promptly break over it the other heart.</p>

<h3><a name="HOW_TO_MAKE_A_PATHETIC_MARINE_POEM" id="HOW_TO_MAKE_A_PATHETIC_MARINE_POEM"></a>HOW TO MAKE A PATHETIC MARINE POEM.</h3>

<p>This kind of poem has the advantage of being easily
produced, yet being at the same time pleasing, and not
unwholesome. As, too, it admits of no variety, the
chance of going wrong in it is very small. Take one
midnight storm, and one fisherman's family, which, if
the poem is to be a real success, should be as large and
as hungry as possible, and must contain at least one
innocent infant. Place this last in a cradle, with the
mother singing over it, being careful that the babe be
dreaming of angels, or else smiling sweetly. Stir the
father well up in the storm until he disappears. Then
get ready immediately a quantity of cruel crawling foam,
in which serve up the father directly on his re-appearance,
which is sure to take place in an hour or two, in the dull
red morning. This done, a charming saline effervescence
will take place amongst the remainder of the family.
Pile up the agony to suit the palate, and the poem will
be ready for perusal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="HOW_TO_WRITE_AN_EPIC_POEM_LIKE_MR_TENNYSON" id="HOW_TO_WRITE_AN_EPIC_POEM_LIKE_MR_TENNYSON"></a>HOW TO WRITE AN EPIC POEM LIKE MR. TENNYSON.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>The following, apart from its intrinsic utility, forms in itself a great
literary curiosity, being the original directions from which the Poet
Laureate composed the Arthurian Idylls.</i>)</p></div>

<p>To compose an epic, some writers instruct us first to
catch our hero. As, however, Mr. Carlyle is the only
person on record who has ever performed this feat, it
will be best for the rest of mankind to be content with
the nearest approach to a hero available, namely a prig.
These animals are very plentiful, and easy to catch, as
they delight in being run after. There are however
many different kinds, not all equally fit for the present
purpose, and amongst which it is very necessary to select
the right one. Thus, for instance, there is the scientific
and atheistical prig, who may be frequently observed
eluding notice between the covers of the "Westminster
Review;" the Anglican prig, who is often caught exposing
himself in the "Guardian;" the Ultramontane prig,
who abounds in the "Dublin Review;" the scholarly
prig, who twitters among the leaves of the "Academy;"
and the Evangelical prig, who converts the heathen, and
drinks port wine. None of these, and least of all the
last, will serve for the central figure, in the present class
of poem. The only one entirely suitable is the blameless
variety. Take, then, one blameless prig. Set him upright
in the middle of a round table, and place beside
him a beautiful wife, who cannot abide prigs. Add to
these, one marred goodly man; and tie the three together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in a bundle with a link or two of Destiny. Proceed,
next, to surround this group with a large number of
men and women of the nineteenth century, in fancy-ball
costume, flavoured with a great many very possible vices,
and a few impossible virtues. Stir these briskly about
for two volumes, to the great annoyance of the blameless
prig, who is, however, to be kept carefully below swearing-point,
for the whole time. If he once boils over
into any natural action or exclamation, he is forthwith
worthless, and you must get another. Next break the
wife's reputation into small pieces; and dust them well
over the blameless prig. Then take a few vials of tribulation
and wrath, and empty these generally over the
whole ingredients of your poem: and, taking the sword
of the heathen, cut into small pieces the greater part of
your minor characters. Then wound slightly the head
of the blameless prig; remove him suddenly from the
table, and keep in a cool barge for future use.</p>

<h3><a name="HOW_TO_WRITE_A_POEM_LIKE_MR_MATTHEW_ARNOLD" id="HOW_TO_WRITE_A_POEM_LIKE_MR_MATTHEW_ARNOLD"></a>HOW TO WRITE A POEM LIKE MR. MATTHEW ARNOLD.</h3>

<p>Take one soulfull of involuntary unbelief, which has
been previously well flavoured with self-satisfied despair.
Add to this one beautiful text of Scripture. Mix
these well together; and as soon as ebullition commences
grate in finely a few regretful allusions to the New Testament
and the lake of Tiberias, one constellation of stars,
half-a-dozen allusions to the nineteenth century, one to
Goethe, one to Mont Blanc, or the Lake of Geneva;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and one also, if possible, to some personal bereavement.
Flavour the whole with a mouthful of "faiths" and
"infinites," and a mixed mouthful of "passions,"
"finites," and "yearnings." This class of poem is
concluded usually with some question, about which we
have to observe only that it shall be impossible to
answer.</p>

<h3><a name="HOW_TO_WRITE_A_POEM_LIKE_MR_BROWNING" id="HOW_TO_WRITE_A_POEM_LIKE_MR_BROWNING"></a>HOW TO WRITE A POEM LIKE MR. BROWNING.</h3>

<p>Take rather a coarse view of things in general. In
the midst of this, place a man and a woman, her and her
ankles, tastefully arranged on a slice of Italy, or the
country about Pornic. Cut an opening across the breast
of each, until the soul becomes visible, but be very careful
that none of the body be lost during the operation.
Pour into each breast as much as it will hold of the new
strong wine of love: and, for fear they should take cold
by exposure, cover them quickly up with a quantity of
obscure classical quotations, a few familiar allusions to an
unknown period of history, and a half-destroyed fresco
by an early master, varied every now and then with a
reference to the fugues or toccatas of a quite-forgotten
composer.</p>

<p>If the poem be still intelligible, take a pen and remove
carefully all the necessary particles.</p>

<h3><a name="HOW_TO_WRITE_A_MODERN_PRE-RAPHAELITE_POEM" id="HOW_TO_WRITE_A_MODERN_PRE-RAPHAELITE_POEM"></a>HOW TO WRITE A MODERN PRE-RAPHAELITE POEM.</h3>

<p>Take a packet of fine selected early English, containing
no words but such as are obsolete and unintelligible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Pour this into about double the quantity of entirely new
English, which must have never been used before, and
which you must compose yourself, fresh as it is wanted.
Mix these together thoroughly till they assume a colour
quite different from any tongue that was ever spoken,
and the material will be ready for use.</p>

<p>Determine the number of stanzas of which your poem
shall consist, and select a corresponding number of the
most archaic or most peculiar words in your vocabulary,
allotting one of these to each stanza; and pour in the
other words round them, until the entire poem is filled
in.</p>

<p>This kind of composition is usually cast in shapes.
These, though not numerous&mdash;amounting in all to something
under a dozen&mdash;it would take too long to describe
minutely here: and a short visit to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s shop in
King street, where they are kept in stock, would
explain the whole of them. A favourite one, however,
is the following, which is of very easy construction. Take
three damozels, dressed in straight night-gowns. Pull
their hair-pins out, and let their hair tumble all about
their shoulders. A few stars may be sprinkled into this
with advantage. Place an aureole about the head of
each, and give each a lily in her hand, about half the size
of herself. Bend their necks all different ways, and set
them in a row before a stone wall, with an apple-tree
between each and some large flowers at their feet.
Trees and flowers of the right sort are very plentiful
in church windows. When you have arranged all these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
objects rightly, take a cast of them in the softest part of
your brain, and pour in your word-composition as above
described.</p>

<p>This kind of poem is much improved by what is
called a burden. This consists of a few jingling words,
generally of an archaic character, about which we have
only to be careful that they have no reference to the
subject of the poem they are to ornament. They are
inserted without variation between the stanzas.</p>

<p>In conclusion we would remark to beginners that this
sort of composition must be attempted only in a perfectly
vacant atmosphere; so that no grains of common-sense
may injure the work whilst in progress.</p>

<p>Take about sixty pages-full of the same word-mixture
as that described in the preceding; and dilute it
with a double quantity of mild modern Anglo-Saxon.
Pour this composition into two vessels of equal size, and
into one of these empty a small mythological story. If
this does not put your readers to sleep soon enough, add
to it the rest of the language, in the remaining vessel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>This recipe is inserted for the benefit of those poets who desire to attain
what is called originality. This is only to be got by following some model
of a past generation, which has ceased to be made use of by the public at

fashionable, than original verses; which two things it is impossible to do
at one and the same time.</i>)</p></div>

<p>Take a couple of fine deadly sins; and let them hang
before your eyes until they become racy. Then take
them down, dissect them, and stew them for some time
in a solution of weak remorse; after which they are to
be devilled with mock-despair.</p>

<p>Take one blaspheming patriot, who has been hung or
buried for some time, together with the oppressed country
belonging to him. Soak these in a quantity of
rotten sentiment, till they are completely sodden; and
in the mean while get ready an indefinite number of
Christian kings and priests. Kick these till they are
nearly dead; add copiously broken fragments of the
Catholic church, and mix all together thoroughly.
Place them in a heap upon the oppressed country; season
plentifully with very coarse expressions; and on
the top carefully arrange your patriot, garnished with
laurel or with parsley; surround with artificial hopes
for the future, which are never meant to be tasted.
This kind of poem is cooked in verbiage, flavoured with
Liberty, the taste of which is much heightened by the
introduction of a few high gods, and the game of Fortune.
The amount of verbiage which Liberty is capable
of flavouring, is practically infinite.</p>
